##### 
About sliders:
 The sliders are a fine thing, but you should also use them with the right feeling.
 Use the filter exclusion list for the sliders. The creation of the sliders is time and resource consuming, minimize this effort to what is necessary. 
 source filters, trim, crop, addborders, prefetch, etc. can also be set wonderfully in the script.
 And there is still the possibility to switch the list on and off in the slider window if you want to see all of them.
#####
About accessing Avisnth in threads:
Even with threads it is easy to crash AvsPmod, the avisynth.dll is coupled with the main thread, 
if an error is triggered by a plugin and the plugin or avisynth crashes, AvsPmod is also torn into the abyss.
The threads only helps if avisynth does not return.
Use program options > Save/Load > 'Backup session when previewing' and the accesses in threads to minimize the risk of losing the script.
#####
How do I sync videos with groups:
If a group was previously selected, delete that group first. Make sure 'Add tab to group' > 'Apply offsets' is checked
Go to the desired position with each video (tab), then select the same group for each video ('Add tab to group'). 
Now all videos should be frame accurately synchronized.
#####
About Avisynth filter plugins *.dll naming:
Please do not use strange characters in the names of the plugins. It is best not to rename the *.dll files. 
Avisynth and AvsPmod can have problems with it. Function names have to be assigned to the associated dll, 
the name has to be split and this can lead to errors. 
AvsPmod can only provide a user-friendly editor if he has no problems with the name of the dll and its function. 
If, for example, there is a '-' in the file name of the dll, AvsPmod will report it at startup, 
please rename this dll and replace the '-' with a '_'


--------------------------
Version 2.7.4.6 [2023-05-27] GPo
--------------------------.
* Play Thread revised:
- under WinXP the frames were played 2-3 frames slower than the intended fps for the video (I hope fixed).
- under Win10 64bit the maximum fps is about 10% higher on my system (FHD no filter). 
* Video > Display, 3 menu items added.
- 'Prefetch RGB display conversion' and 'Fast YUV420 display conversion' and ' - fast YUV auto reset'
- Prefetch RGB display conversion: uses Prefetch(2,2) for the default (precise) RGB32 conversion (I recommend to turn it on, default).
- Fast YUV420 display conversion: function 'DecodeYUVtoRGB' must exist (DecodeYUVtoRGB.dll) and CPU instructions AVX2 available.
- if DecodeYUVtoRGB used, prefetch is disabled. So both can always be switched on.
- the fast YUV decode will be always disable if: Preview Filter used or on clip refresh the option ' - fast YUV auto reset' enabled.
- if function DecodeYUVtoRGB not found, the function is loaded from AvsPmod dir if the Dll exist.
* Added CPU AVX2 availability check. If not, fast YUV decoding is disabled. Also disabled on x86 (no x86 DLL).
- Big thanks to DTL and all contributors for this plugin. Also pinterf will improve the precise YUV to RGB32 conversion. Thanks.
* Bugfix: Split View can get error on insert new tab and the video dimensions mismatch.
* Bugfix of Bugfix: Fullscreen mode, if video dimensions equal to monitor dimensions.
* Improved error handling for some conditions.

--------------------------
Version 2.7.4.5 [2023-05-06] GPo
--------------------------
* Added audio playback, for full Info please read the readme_audio.txt
- for faster playback: use 'Split Clip' and put Prefetch after the 'Resample Filter', see below (Options > Resample Filter)
* Added audio scrubbing (audio sound while video frame is scrolling)
* Added to play button context menu:'Play audio', 'Audio scrubbing', 'Audio scrub count'.
* Added to Video > Play video > 'Play audio', 'Play scrub', 'Audio scrubbing', 'Downmix audio' (make a shortcut for 'Play scrub').
* Added to Play button context menu 'Audio volume'. increase/decrease in Decibel.
- Note: There is no level limiter, the audio can get clipping. 
* Added Options > 'Prefetch display conversion' (Test it, I have it enabled).
- the function uses Prefetch(2,2) for RGB conversion for the display. 
- this speeds up the video frame drawing by about 1 to 30% depending on the color format. So also the playback.
- if this function is switched on, the prefetch for the 'Resample filter' (see below) is superfluous and therefore not used.
* Resample Filter (resample zoom):
- it is now posible do use another function after the resample filter, the function must be writen after the resizer separated by a semicolon.
- example: Spline36Resize;Prefetch(1) or Spline36Resize;sharpen(0.2).Prefetch(1) is also posible.
- use prefetch after the resizer for more playback speed when the 'Resample Filter' is enabled.
* The External Player button has got a context menu in which the function of the button can be selected (External Player, Audio scrub).
- audio scrub will play min 36 video frames or 48 if audio scrub count 48 
* Added Menubar > Options > 'Restore fullscreen', when toggle with the middle mouse button.
* Changed color of timeline selection markers for video controls dark theme.
* Improved 'Preview Filter' speed a bit.
* Fixed drawing snapshot if 'Split View alternate' enabled.
* Fixed: rare occurrence when clip frame count is 0 no error handling was done.
* Bugfix: 'Fast Clip' ignored 'Toggle Tags' (Filters could not be switched off with 'Toggle Tags').
* Bugfix: Copy new tab
* Some other changes

* Some other changes

--------------------------
Version 2.7.3.8 - 2.7.3.9 [2023-03-11] GPo
--------------------------
* Fix: Fullscreen mode did not work with larger video dimensions.
- some code additions and changes for the Fullscreen mode.
* Big Note: 
- If Avisynth is trimmed too much with SetMemoryMax, all AvsPmod filters will take longer. 
- The Resample filter normally takes less than 1 second, but if the Avisynth memory is reduced too much, it can take 10 seconds.
* When exiting the Fullscreen mode, the slider window is restored if it was visible before. 
* If AvsPmod is terminated, it now looks nicer.
* 2.7.3.9 Fix: The fullscreen window sometimes appeared in normal size when fullscreen was not active.

--------------------------
Version 2.7.3.7 [2023-03-05] GPo
--------------------------
* Added Fullscreen mode, old Fullscreen mode now called Fullsize (you must set new shortcut)
- press Shift on double clicking the video or use menu Video > Additional > 'Fullscreen'
- remainder: Press Ctrl on double clicking the video for Fullsize mode
* Added Program Options > Misc2 > 'Fullscreen zoom' default normal fill, read the readme_FullscreenZoom.txt in the Archive.
- for Resample: the Resample zoom must be enabled, Program Options > Misc2 > 'Show Resample zoom menu'

- they are hidden again when you left-click in the video window.
* Added Program options > Misc2 > 'Display filter enabled on startup'
* Numbers Wheel faster option is now disabled at start (otherwise the last decimal digit could not be changed).
- toggle between fast and normal: if active then a middle mouse click. The status bar shows the status.
* When the video is drawn with Resize Filter a small green triangle is visible in the upper left corner.
* Fixed: At the top left of the video window sometimes appeared a small square (10x10 pixel).

- here is an example video: https://vimeo.com/user183482922
* Added Video > Tools > 'Locate frame' finds a frame in another clip. Read the Locate frame readme. https://vimeo.com/797835669
* Added alternative Split View functionality (Video > Split View alternate)
- grab the splitter or press CTRL when clicking in the video window to place the splitter at the mouse position. 
- Note: this menu is only the options switch, to switch Split View on or off the menu 'Split View' must be used.
- only if Split View is switched off and you hit this menu, then Split View is switched on.
* Added Group > 'Split View freeze frame', freezes the frame of the not selected partner tab.
- offset the SplitView: Freeze frame > navigate to frame > select a group (group is set for both tabs and freeze frame is turned off).
* Statusbar shows information of the active Split View tab: current tab L or R, Frame offset and frozen status. 
- e.g. (SV-L -17, frozen R) current Split View tab is the left tab, -17 frames offset to right tab and right tab is frozen.
* Split View now asks if the tab should be copied if the next right tab (video) has different dimensions.
* If you disable Split View on the right partner tab and enable it again, Split View uses the left tab
- if the left tab was the last used partner (previously, the right tab was always taken as a partner).
* Video Window Display Border spacing and Snapshot font size changed from fixed values to DPI resulting values.
* Slider window 'Custom color theme' now default (when the options.dat is missing).
* 'Resize video window' now default (when the options.dat is missing).
* Snapshot: automatically take snapshot 2 on clip refresh now default true (when the options.dat is missing).

* Some other smal changes
* Version 2.7.3.5: Bugfix: There was an error when 'Fast Clip' is enabled but Avisynth loading in threads is disabled.
* Version 2.7.3.6: Bugfix: Same reason as in 2.7.3.5 but a different trigger. Sorry.
-
Reminder 'Resize filter' and normal zoom:
The resize filter is switched on under Program Options > Misc 2 > 'Show resample zoom menu'.
-
Zoom and resize filter change with the mouse wheel:
zoom = Ctrl down or press left mouse button
resize filter = Shift down (mouse button does not have to be pressed)
-
Zoom and resize filter change 1x or 2x zoom:
zoom = press left mouse button and click right mouse button
resize filter = same but Shift must be pressed
-
Resize filter Fill or Fit:
double click on the top or bottom right of the video window (50x50 pixel x DPI).
at the top only the current tab and bottom all tabs.
-
I recommend not to use the antialiasing in the normal zoom and to use the resample filter instead.

--------------------------
* New tool in the 'Tool' menu, Session Info (session_info.pyo), check it.
- if you are updating only the AvsPmod directory, you need to copy from the archive tools\'session_info.pyo' and 'ToolsMenu.py' to 
- the AvsPmod tools folder and delete the file AvsPmod > tools > ToolsMenu.pyo
- tool info: all changes made have no effect on the original files, only when the session is saved, the changes are written to the file to be saved.
* Fixed: On closing all tabs or reloading the startup session an error can be displayed.
* Fixed: flickering when the frame was displayed and the thread progress option is 2 or 3 and the frame loading took longer.
* Changed mouse movement in the status bar if left mouse button down and timeline range is set: 
- CTRL = unlimited scrolling; SHIFT = unlimited scrolling and sensitivity 25%, i.e. 4 times scrolling rate.
- Summing:

--------------------------
* New option for the thread progress dialog. Program Options > Misc 2 > 'Thread progress dialog behave'.
- option 1 is chosen as default so that there are no surprises for users who do not read the changelog. So choose your option yourself.
- 3 options available (default 1, option 1 is also used if the preview window not visible): 
-- Show progress (that's the old), program can be minimized with the windows system button 'Minimize', but the program can get the "no response" status.
-- Show progress (Shift hide/show the program), windows system buttons are disabled, the program cannot get a "no response" status. 
-- Hide progress (Ctrl to show progress, Shift hide/show the program), windows system buttons disabled, the program cannot get a "no response" status.
-- Note* if option 2 or 3 selected:
--- if you want to minimize AvsPmod during a longer clip loading process, press Shift for 0.5 to 2 seconds do minimize or show AvsPmod. 
--- if you hide it with Shift, the progress dialog is shown. If you minimize the program and shows it again during the loading process, 
--- the slider window is not redrawn and is invisible (I don't know if I can fix this).
- 
* Added the option "I" frame to the context menu of the forward/backward jump buttons. 
* DPI scaling options revised, removed not useful options and added 'slider window' and created an extra dialog.
* When saving the script, a dialog is displayed if "user sliders" are found but the option to save/read the "marked" script is not enabled.
* Fixed: If the 'Resample Filter' was used during video playback and was changed, the playback speed then slowed down.
* Fixed: Slider window 'radio buttons' looks now nicer if OS DPI scaling used.
* Fixed: No new sliders were created when the clip refresh was triggered by clicking in the video window.
* Note: The 'Preview Filter' will only update if it is turned on, otherwise the shortcut for turning it off or on or 
- the 'Preview Filter' checkbox must be used.
* In the Options Dialog some options moved to another tab e.g. 'Min. Text lines when video preview visible' to tab 'Text'
* Some other changes

--------------------------
Version 2.7.2.3 [2022-07-24] GPo
--------------------------
* Bugfix: If the 'Resample filter' was used and a 'Preview filter' was set there was an error message.

--------------------------

--------------------------
* Thread progress dialog can now be hidden. Program Options > Misc 2 > 'Hide thread progress dialog (Press Ctrl to show)'
- hides only the progress dialog if the video window visible on creating or refreshing a clip.
- if you press Ctrl for 0.5 to 2 seconds (depends on the thread state), the dialog is shown.

* Some other changes

--------------------------
Version 2.7.2.1 [2022-07-15] GPo, (a lot of news and improvements)
--------------------------
* Added slider window checkbox 'Preview filter', enables/disables the last used 'Preview filter' or P-Filter 1 if no last used index found.
* 'Preview filter' is now restored if a filter outside the 'Preview filter' area changed.
* 'Preview filter' is also restored when enabling/disabling the 'Split Clip'.
* 'Preview filter' for the 'Split Clip' is also possible.
-
* 'Split Clip' is fully integrated (pixel values, video information, etc.). Help > 'Split Clip readme'
* Added menu Video > Additional > 'Restore split clip if enabled' (default off).
- restores the 'Split Clip' if was active before refreshing the script.
* If you want, you can set the color of the 'Split Clip' for the timeline in the context menu of the frame numbers text field.
-
* Added function jump to I frame, the frame properties must of course allow this.
- search depth max. 350 frames, Esc breaks, Statusbar gives information, use 'Split Clip' or disable all filters for faster finding.
- use menu Video > Navigate > 'Next I frame' or 'Previous I frame' or 
- if frame property window visible and mouse is over the properties (Win10) or focused, with mouse browse buttons you can jump:
-- with Ctrl to next or previous I frame
-- with Shift to next or previous selection marker
-- with Alt to next or previous titled bookmark
-- without key to any next or previous marker (selection, bookmark)
-
* 'Number wheel' can be enabled or disabled under Edit > Enable 'Number wheel'.
* 'Number wheel', change the fast decimal part rate with middle mouse click works now only if a number selected, if no number is selected 
- the 'Number wheel' function will be disabled. This improves the unintentional switching when the middle click should actually activate the preview.
- I'm not entirely happy with it, either the switch normal/fast will be removed or I'll think of something better.
-
* Added program options > Misc 2 > 'Show memory information in thread progress dialog' (default True).
- displays the available system memory in the thread progress dialog (5 seconds after the dialog appears).
* Added program options > Misc 2 > 'Show shortcuts in context menus*' Shows or hides the shortcuts in the video and script context menus.
-
* When 'Accessing Avisynth in Threads' is used, the program no longer gets the "No response" status when a clip is reinitialized. 
- the video image is fully preserved while waiting for the clip (Not when waiting for a frame or no image visible).
- it's a bit beta, you can disable it under Options > 'Draw the frame during clip refresh (Beta)', please report problems!
* Avisynth error messages on creating a clip corrected. It was always shown (Make sure avisynth is installed...).  
* Some other changes.

--------------------------

- If you enable the function by a double-click on a number: 
--- you can change the decimal part rate (normal/fast) by a middle mouse click (the status bar gives feedback).
--- the fast decimal part rate is: default = .1, Ctrl = .2, Shift = .5  also (2.35, 2.45, 2.75)
--- you can also change the numbers using the 'left' and 'right' keyboard keys
* Program options > Misc 2 > 'Mouse wheel scroll rate in editor (0 disabled)' if you have it enabled you can double the rate by pressing Ctrl
* Function Split Clip revised: 
- if no further filter was used after /**avsp_split**/ at least 'last' had to be written into the script otherwise no split clip was created.
- this is now done automatically if no other filter is found.

--------------------------
Version 2.7.1.8 [2022-06-12] GPo, Milestone Edition
--------------------------
* New function Video > 'Split Clip on/off' (please read Help -> 'SplitClip readme')
- the 'Split Clip' splits the main clip into 2 clips, and allows you to switch between 
- a fast preview (without filters) and a normal preview (create a shortcut key for quick switching). 
-
* Editor new: Changing numbers or true/false with the mouse wheel (Help -> 'Number wheel readme').
- select an area containing numbers, press Ctrl or Shift or both and use the mouse wheel. Ctrl = 1, Shift = 5, Both = 10
- the first number group found is changed (maximum search depth for the first digit are 20 characters).
- Recommended*: select the numbers or true/false with a double-click, no pressing of Ctrl or Shift is required. Numbers are then changed by 1
- if the selection is made by double-click: The function must be deactivated by a single click.
- true/false can now be changed either with (left down and right click) or (with the mouse wheel).
-
* New entry in tabs context menu 'Sort by name' sorts the tabs in alphabetical order.

--------------------------
Version 2.7.1.7 [2022-05-29] GPo
--------------------------
** If you use DPI zoom in windows read the changelog of version 2.7.1.6 **
* Fixed flickering when zooming with the mouse wheel.

--------------------------
Version 2.7.1.6 [2022-05-28] GPo
--------------------------
* DPI scaling revised:
- the calculation basis is now the pixel size (previously point size). The font sizes now match the set system zoom. 
- if you have adjusted the DPI scaling differently, you may have to do this again. The font size can now be larger.
- now all extra values can be adjusted from -20% to 100% and DPI scaling manually from -20 to 200%.
- the DPI scaling for the tabs can now be more fine adjust. 10% makes a differenze.
- with a 27 inch QHD monitor and 100% system zoom try +10% for the tabs if your eyes are a bit older..;) 
* For Fullsize/Fullscreen mode the visibility of the tabs can be set (Program Options > Video > 'Fullscreen/Fullsize mode').
* Added to Crop-Editor autocrop mod 2 and mod 4 (negative calculation, (crop less)).
* Added new menus (tab context, file menu) 'Reload all scripts'
* Display option 'Resize video window' revised.
* When a script has been changed and the program is closed, a dialog appears asking whether the changes should be saved.

* Separate video window: Again some glitches fixed.
* DPI scaling for tabs and video controls can now also be reduced (maximum -20%, but not less than 100%)
* The default width of the slider window at program start (for a new tab) can be saved in the context menu of the slider window.
* New menu: Options > 'Multiline tab style' you can change it on the fly.
* Video > 'Resize video window' has been moved to Video > 'Additional', you must create a new shortcut for it.

* Fix: flickering when zooming with the keyboard and 'Resize video window' is selected.
- note: option 'Resize video window' only works with keyboard zoom or if the video height changed.
* Improved: separate video window and 'Resize filter' behavior. 
* Fix: if use separate video window enabled, deleting bookmarks doesn't work properly.
* Fix: separate video window saves now its size and position on exit.
* Fixed some glitches with the separate video window, but I do not recommend using it. 
* For the file extensions based templates there is a new modifier ><. readme_d2v_based_template.txt

--------------------------
Version 2.7.1.1 [2022-04-28] GPo
--------------------------
* When normal zoom and resample zoom are used together, the status bar shows it separately e.g. (1.25 x r0.8x) 
* If there were tabs in a group, XY and Zoom were saved for the group,
- this was bad when in a group there were videos with different dimensions. 
- now the values are saved for each tab regardless of the group.
* Fixed: If the trim or crop editor was showing and an attempt was made to switch tabs, 
- the bookmarks were deleted from the timeline after the warning message (tab cannot be change).
* Fixed script min text lines if tab multiline enabled and tabs row count > 1. 
* Fixed flickering when zooming with the mouse wheel.
* Some small other changes.

--------------------------
Version 2.7.1.0 [2022-04-02] GPo
--------------------------
* Update filterdb.dat, the new filterdb.dat is only usable from AvsPmod 2.7.10 (some things added)
- update some internal avisynth filters to avs+ versions (you must override the old filterdb.dat with the new one).
- also added as hints filters with different parameters e.g. AssumeFPS and comment hints e.g. Overlay.
- calltip displays pixel types now in short format e.g. ColorBars.
* Now the resize filter can also be used with the mouse wheel by pressing Shift and the left mouse button.
- so: without shift normal zoom, with shift resample zoom ( when activated under Program Settings -> Misc 2)
- this also applies to the 2x zoom function (press left mouse button and click right).
* Fixed: on start up, matrix menus doesn't display the correct defaults if only one tab loaded.
* Fixed: flicker on first displaying the video windwow or different video dimensions.

--------------------------
Version 2.7.0.9 [2022-02-25] GPo
--------------------------
* 'Run analysis pass' changed, no 'extra avisynth frames' are triggered.
* Added 'Run FPS analysis', similar to 'Run analysis pass' but no extra clip is created and nothing is released. 
* Fixed resize filter on copy tab
* Fixed ? CLI Encoder, win OS cannot find encode.bat (x264 doesn't start)
- if you only update the AvsPmod files you have to delete the file 'encoder_gui.pyo' under AvsPmod\tools 
- and replace 'encoder_gui.py' with the new one.
* New macro 'Run analysis pass', explanations are in the macro.

--------------------------
Version 2.7.0.8 [2022-??-??] GPo
--------------------------
* Frame properties can now be displayed in the slider window. Program options > Misc 2 > 'Show frame properties*'
- the height can be changed in the context menu of the property text field.
- double click in the property text field to increase the height by 50%
- Note: If the property window is visible, the properties are read for each frame (Even with closed slider window). 
- If you want to save some CPU time you should close the property window when the properties are not needed.
- During playback no properties are read. 
* On Display or Resize filter error, avisynths error message is now shown is it available.
* Some minor fixes
* I mention the "preview filters" that have become an essential part of AvsPmod.

** Avisynth 3.71 final version has problems with prefetch and frame properties. **
AvsPmod also reads the frame properties when creating a clip, so avisynth hangs. 
There are two ways to avoid this:
Video > Display > YUV -> RGB > 'Read from source or script' must be disabled.
or
Use Avisynth version 3.72 test 3, the problem was fixed here.

* Pixel values of all color formats can now be displayed. (a big 'thank you' to StvG for the active help) 
* Changed the display of the calculated pixel values in the status bar.
- the not readable values now only calculated from 8bit. If the source is 8bit, 
- an asterisk is displayed in front of the value as usual, otherwise 8bit_ is put in front. 
- if you want to show the alpha channel you must set %CLR for the status bar value modifiers. 
* fixed some errors on closing tabs

* Error message handling improved  

--------------------------
Version 2.7.0.3 [2022-01-15] GPo
--------------------------
* Add program options > Misc2 'Show video control button tooptips', show/hide tooltips.
* Add Video > Additional > 'Use previous frame time'
- when refreshing with F5 or Video window focus or mouse middle button: 
- if frame count <> previous frame count and frame rate <> previous frame rate 
- then the new frame number is generated from the previous frame time. 
* Improved error messages: On create display clip more information in case of errors, 
- and an attempt is made to use an alternative RGB32 conversion, this is then displayed as an error in a dialog. 
- but note: Something is wrong and the displayed result may be wrong.  
* Fixed: display filter text was converted to lower case. So eg. propSet("_Matrix") don't work.
* Some glitches with the 'Resize filter' fixed.
* Fixed: the preview was not updated if text was changed in the script and the script did not have the focus.
* New Russian translation file from Doom9 user Arx1meD.

--------------------------
Version 2.7.0.2 [2021-12-25] GPo, It's New Year's Eve soon
--------------------------
* Added Video > 'Resize video window'
- if switched on (default off), the video window is adapted to the size of the video when the tab or
- the zoom factor is changed (exception zooming with the mouse).
- if the resize filter is used, I recommend deactivating this option when there are small and large videos in the tabs. 
* Bugfix zoom menu, the values are not displayed visually in the menu.
* Bugfix for double clicking on the script / video window splitter
* Bugfix for menu 'Video information' while resize filter is activated
* Bugfix for avisynth versions smaller then 3.71  
- AvsPmod crashes while trying reading the matrix from the properties (the bug was created in 2.6.9.9)
* Some minor changes

--------------------------
Version 2.7.0.1 [2021-12-19] GPo, It's Christmas soon
--------------------------
* Added a preview resize filter, please read the readme_resampleFilter.txt (Help > 'Resample filter readme')
- in order not to overwhelm beginners or people who rarely use AvsPmod, the resample menu is switched off by default.
- the menu (off, as submenu, normal) can be changed under the program options > Misc2 'Show resample zoom menu'
* Added Video > 'Save pos & zoom on tab change' 
- if it is activated, the position as well as the zoom settings (zoom, fit, fill) are saved
- and restored (if possible) when changing tabs. It is a supplement to 'Save view pos on tab change' 
- which only saves the position.
* The _last_session.ses is saved at program start as '_last_session_backup.ses'
- the next time the program is started, it will be saved with a date name in the 'ProgramDir\SessionBackups' directory.
- the number of backups can be set under program options > Save/Load (default 3) 
- Warning! Do not save any sessions yourself in the 'SessionBackups' directory with name begin _session_backup_ 
- these files can be deleted.
* Added menu File > 'Reload startup session'
- saves the current tabs as session in the 'SessionBackups' folder, closes all tabs 
- and opens the _last_session_backup (the backup of the _last_session on startup).   
* The video window is no longer automatically resized as often.
* The video slider button changes the color when a video frame is requested or again readed or the button pressed. 
* 32bit Version: fix for classic avisynth 32bit versions.
* Some other small fixes.
* Hint: So that the session is saved at the end of the program, 
- 'Save session for next launch' must be activated under the program options 'Save \ Load'. 

--------------------------
Version 2.7.0.0 [2021-11-13] GPo
--------------------------
* Added Program options > Misc > 'Show warning for plugin functions parse errors'
- if it is deactivated, no error message appears with incompatible (wrong) plugin function names. 
- the plugin (the function) does not get any support for extended AvsPmod functions.
* User wishes: editor popup menu entry 'Delete'
* Bugfix: display of pixel values higher than 8bit (thanks again to pinterf)
* A nice version number that should stick for a while... I hope.

--------------------------
Version 2.6.9.9 [2021-11-07] GPo
--------------------------
* Pixel values higher than 8bit can now be displayed (thanks to pinterf (pfmode) for the code)
- Hex values are now also calculated from the returned avisynth YUV / RGB values
- if the value is read from the display, it is preceded by an asterisk  
* Fixed slider windows show/hide exclusions filter list

--------------------------
Version 2.6.9.8 [2021-10-25] GPo
--------------------------
* Added reading frame properties (At least AviSynth+ 3.71 is required for full support).
- deactivated during playback
- if the property window is closed, reading is also deactivated
* Added Options > Font & colors > Advanced 2 'Properties window' set text style for the property window
* Added Display > YUV -> RGB > 'Reset matrix if not found' 
- normally the matrix is retained if it could be read once, if this option is selected it is reset to the
- default value if it cannot be read. 
* Fixed: Loading older font & colors backup files
* Bugfix Statusbar ads are not updated immediately

--------------------------
Version 2.6.9.7xx only test versions
--------------------------

--------------------------
Version 2.6.9.6 [2021-09-29] GPo
--------------------------
* Change menu naming File > 'Toggle last two tabs' to 'Previously selected tab', you must recreate the shortcut for it.
* Fixed zooming with keyboard and program startup with last zoom settings doesn't work. 
- Note: 100%, fill and fit is always restored at program startup.
- only if you want to restore 2x or something similar you must turn on Options > Video > 'Startup with last zoom settings'  
* Fixed 'Auto take snapshot 2' doesn't work on frame number 0

--------------------------
Version 2.6.9.5 [2021-09-25] GPo
--------------------------
* Added to slider window snapshot popup menu 'Copy snapshot 2 to 1'
* Zoom values in the status bar that are not equal to 1 are now always displayed in decimal
* Added File > 'Toggle last two tabs', toggles between the last two selected tabs (idea by Dogway)
* Fixed 'Auto take snapshot 2', if several tabs were open, the wrong frame number could be used as a snapshot 

--------------------------
Version 2.6.9.4 [2021-09-18] GPo
--------------------------
* Added selectable delay for thread progress dialog ( program options Misc 2 )
* Added automatically take snapshot on clip refresh ( Video > Snapshot > 'Auto take snapshot 2' )
- better than staring at the screen for 30 seconds...and then still miss the moment
- also added on slider window Snapshot popup menu 'Auto take snapshot 2'
- preview filters do not trigger a snapshot only when the clip is initialized (refreshed)
- if active, then 'Make 2' is changed to '*Make 2' in the slider window 
* Error treatment for the 'Use advanced frame thread' revised

--------------------------
Version 2.6.9.3 [2021-09-10] GPo
--------------------------
* 'Apply filter' revised. Preview filter is now also possible as a default in the templates. 
- /**avsp_filter must be at the beginning of the template.
- the templates for this have been updated. 

--------------------------
Version 2.6.9.2 [2021-09-10] GPo
--------------------------
* Added to the timeline selections context menu 'Apply filter' and to the Options menu 'Apply filters...'
- insert one or more filters in a part of the clip (selected with the Trim Editor), or for other things, think of something.
- templates can be created for this (Options > 'Apply filters...'), which are then inserted into the script   
- please read the applyfilters_readme.txt ( Help > 'Apply filters readme' )
* Added Options > 'Display filters...', you can create templates for the display filter
- the templates can be selected from the menu Video > Display > 'Select display filter...'
- if you choose a template, the current display filter will be overwritten!
- renamed 'Configure display filter' to 'Edit current display filter...' (This does not change the template)
* Changed all default options for 'Accessing Avisynth in threads' to True (enabled)
- only noticeable if no options.dat is available 

--------------------------
Version 2.6.9.1 [2021-08-28] GPo
--------------------------
* Added menus Video > Display > 'Display filter' and 'Configure display filter'
- you can add avisynth code (filters) and it is used as last filter for all scripts.
- this filter affects only the display drawing! 
- on changing the display filter the current script does remain the preview filter state if video window visible, 
- all other scripts does turn off the preview filter.
- you can use short macro code by adding #> at line begin, e.g. #>avsp.GetWindow().OnMenuVideoZoom(zoomfactor=1) 
- Note: The filter requires the same CPU time as if it were written in the script.  
- link a shortcut for quick switching, the filter is at program startup always off.
* Added menu Edit > Miscelaneos > 'Set selection as display filter...' see above.
* Under Program Options > Misc2 the default display conversion YUV -> RGB can be set, which is used for a new tab (script)
* Added menu File > 'New tab from template'
- you can create a template for a new tab by adding an entry with an asterisk * in the file extension templates. 
* Bugfix writing the matrix into the script led to an error if the matrix was already written into the script.   
* Some other changes

--------------------------
Version 2.6.9.0 [2021-08-15] GPo
--------------------------
* Play thread modified, ~14% faster ( without filter ).
- hopefully bug under Win7 fixed 
* Bugfix middle mouse button on a selections mark in the timeline ( trying to delete the mark causes an error )
* Bugfix 'Save Image Sequence', fixed AvsPmod and macro code
* Added to filterdb.dat Dogway's ex_contrast

--------------------------
Version 2.6.8.9 [2021-08-07] GPo
--------------------------
* Improved get_frame threading ( lower CPU usage on Win10 )
* Play thread now multi threaded. 
- the speed up varies on the video dimensions and used filters and
- goes down to 0 with heavy filters or big video dimensions (no hardware acceleration).
- on my sytem: video 1280x720 without a filter and 100% zoom, before 120 fps now 178 fps
* Slider window refresh on Win10 improved.
* Slider window snapshot button (label) gets feedback on making a snapshot.
* Slider window scroll rate increased to 40 pixel 
* Added to filterdb.dat 'KNLMeansCL' 
* Some other changes

--------------------------
Version 2.6.8.8 [2021-08-02] GPo
--------------------------
* Completely new threaded playback routine.
- especially under Win10 this should result in lower CPU usage, higher speed and a smoother playback. 
* Add custom editor mouse wheel handler ( Program options > Misc2 > 'Mouse wheel scroll rate on editor' )
- One user reports problems with the mouse wheel while the PC is running for a long time (40 days). Maybe it helps.
- Or you want change the scroll rate: 1 to 5 lines ( default 0 = custom handler disabled )
* Add to video slider context menu 'Timeline to trims' and 'Timeline to clips'
- inserts the complete timeline into the script as trims, separated by the selections. 

--------------------------
Version 2.6.8.7 [2021-07-15] GPo
--------------------------
* Add to menu File > 'Clear file history'
* Bugfix advanced frame thread ( Options > 'Use advanced frame thread' )
* Bugfix 'Write selected preview filter to script', at the end a * was missing ( **/ )
* Bugfix filterdb.dat, entry for 'MCTemporalDenoise' was buggy

--------------------------
Version 2.6.8.6 [2021-07-04] GPo
--------------------------
* Fixed again some shortcut problems
* Minor other changes

--------------------------
Version 2.6.8.5 [2021-06-27] GPo
--------------------------
* New Frame thread routine Options > 'Use advanced frame thread'
- it is Beta! a bit faster, one single frame thread per script, test it out and report problems.
* Timeline shows frame or time numbers if a timeline range is set
- program options > Misc 2 > 'Timeline range numbers count', you can change the count of numbers (1, 4, 9)
* The sensitivity of the mouse movement on the status bar for moving the timeline range is adjustable
-  program options > Misc 2 > 'Timeline move on status bar sensitivity', lower values more movement
* A double click on the status bar moves the timeline in the limited area forwards or backwards, depending on the position of the mouse pointer
- if Shift is held, the entire area is moved without limit 
* A middle click on the status bar moves the timline back to the current frame
* Fxed: if not timeline 'Auto reset' was set, on tab change the wrong frame was shown
* Fix: I hope some shortcut problems fixed
* New russian translation, thanks to Doom9 user Arx1meD

--------------------------
Version 2.6.8.4 [2021-06-17] GPo
--------------------------
* SplitView now also recognizes group offsets ( nice for compare two same videos with different start offsets )
* Timeline range can be moved with 'hard coded shortcuts'
- Ctrl + Alt + Left or Right ( moves 10% steps in the limited range )
- Ctrl + Alt + Up or Down ( moves the complette range ), then slider position does not match the picture.
- the now displayed frame number can be updated with the 'Enter' or 'Return' or a frame step, if you have not updated and 
- you hold down Ctrl while hitting 'Enter' or 'Return' the timeline moves back to the current frame number
- there is one setting under program options > Video > 'Move video slider to timeline start', read the tooltip 
* Update macro PreviewEncode.py
* Fixed: if a resize filter was set with a 'Preview Filter' during playback, an error message could appear.  
* Fixed: the context menu of the text editor could crash under certain conditions 
-
How do I sync videos with groups:
If a group was previously selected, delete that group first. Make sure 'Add tab to group' > 'Apply offsets' is checked
Go to the desired position with each video (tab), then select the same group for each video ('Add tab to group'). 
Now all videos should be frame accurately synchronized. 

--------------------------
Version 2.6.8.3 [2021-06-11] GPo
--------------------------
* Added the ability to move the timeline range
- move left or right on the status bar with the left mouse button pressed 
- the shift value is calculated depending on the size of the area, if you press the control key the value is 1 
- the range of movement is limited to the slider position, if the shift key is pressed, the range is not limited,
- but then the displayed image no longer matches the displayed slider position, you then have to click on the slider again.
* The video slider has been given a context menu
- if you click with the right mouse button directly on a selection (blue area), the full menu is displayed else only the 'Trim editor' menu
* Status bar info %TM removed, a similar information is now displayed on the video slider
* Added macro PreviewResize.py 
- is intended for playback with display zoom < 100%,  more information is written in the macro.
* Update PreviewEncode.py macro (showDialog, save and read the options, and more)
* New macro 'DeleteEndodings.py' in macro subfolder 'Extra'. Is intended as a supplement to 'PreviewEncode' 
* Small bugfixes in timeline range   

--------------------------
Version 2.6.8.2 [2021-06-02] GPo
--------------------------
* Add menu Video > 'Timeline range'
- you can set the range for the video slider from 50 to 2000 frames in steps, or a custom range or start and end separated by a comma.
- is not start and end is specified the current position is the calculations center for the range (set range 200 at pos 500 results in frame range 400 to 600 )  
- if a range set, the playback ignores the selections and plays the timeline range in a loop if 'Play loop' activated and not 'Auto scroll' is set
- the background color of the slider and selections is changed when a range is set 
* The status bar has got a context menu 'Timeline ranges', the custom timeline settings can only be accessed from here. 
- if 'Auto scroll' set, the timeline range scrolls automatically if a frame outside the current range selected (key, mouse wheel, bookmark jump, etc.) 
- if 'Auto reset' set, the range resets if the video frame count change or you set the range and the script was not initialized.
- If the slider is in the area of a selection and 'Custom range' is selected, the slider area is entered as a default in the dialog box.
* New  status bar info %TR and %TM stands for Timeline range. (program settings > Video > 'Configure video statusbar')
- %TR or %TM shows nothing if 100% Range is set, at Range 200:  %TR shows [200] and %TM [start-end], use one of them.. should be enough.
- a good place should be after the frame count value  'Frame %F / %FC %TR -  (%T)' 
* Added selections and bookmark information to the Video information ( Video > Video information )
* On Win10, the mouse wheel should now also work in the status bar.
* Added macro 'PreviewEncode.py' ( update 2021.06.01 ) to the macro folder
- encodes fhe selections and insert the clips and trims into the script ( for a fast preview )
- please open the macro with an text editor and read the info and change the paths and templates according to your needs.

--------------------------
Version 2.6.8.1 [2021-05-24] GPo
--------------------------
* Without words ;) 

--------------------------
Version 2.6.8.0 [2021-05-24] GPo
--------------------------
* Bugfix and update: display YUV > RGB conversion showed wrong values. 
- the matrix actually read is displayed in brackets behind the matrix currently in use. 

--------------------------
Version 2.6.7.9 [2021-05-23] GPo
--------------------------
* Split View can now show the Snapshots
* Split View remembers the last X, Y coordinates and the zoom factor when you turn off Split View.
- in short, you can go from split view to normal view and compare the image using the tab selection, 
- if you don't change the frame number you can switch back to the previous Split View. 
* Auto Preview now only closes the video window. So you can look at the scripts via tab even if auto preview is switched on.
- the uninitialized tabs are still skipped if the tabs are changed with the mouse forwards/backwards buttons or the mouse wheel. 
* Bugfix (I hope): 'Add toggle tag' from the slider window context menu. Toggle tag was sometimes incorrectly placed in the script.

--------------------------
Version 2.6.7.8 [2021-05-16] GPo
--------------------------
* With large video dimensions, the display drawing is much faster.
* Split View drawing routine improved and zoom option 'fit inside' fixed
* Bugfix: AvsPmod can crash if a resize filter is used in the preview filters. 
- the reason is the pixel information that does not match the x, y coordinates of the mouse pointer. 
- if a resize filter is now used in the preview filter, the pixel information is only read from the display. 
* New frame thread routine disabled, get thread errors.
* some other small changes

--------------------------
Version 2.6.7.7 [2021-05-14] GPo
--------------------------
* New option Options > 'On cancel assign the clip later' ( Refer to 'Accessing Avisynth in threads' )
- AvsPmod should normally be closed after a thread has been canceled by the user. 
- this option tries to assign the clip to the script after the user has canceled the thread and the thread has been terminated internally.
- nice for indexing, you can play with AvsPmod with another tab and a message appears if the clip process finished.
- but test it, it's a bit alpha or beta or whatever. It's going smoothly for me, but you never know what the user is doing. ;)
* New frame thread routine Options > 'Use new frame thread routine. Beta!'
- Please test and report the differences, on my system under Win7 the new routine only brings 2.5 fps more playback speed.  
- I had expected more of it for the long hours of work. I'm sad ;) But maybe it works better on another system.
- The old routine works fine for me, I've never had a thread error. If no one gives me positive feedback about the new routine, it will be removed. 
- To compare, please do not use any filters in the script and set playback speed to maximum and zoom to 100%
- The fps is displayed on the left in the status bar. The videos shouldn't be bigger than HD otherwise the difference in the routines will be minimized.

/*
About accessing Avisnth in threads:
Even with thrads it is easy to crash AvsPmod, the avisynth.dll is coupled with the main thread, 
if an error is triggered by a plugin and the plugin or avisynth crashes, AvsPmod is also torn into the abyss.
The threads only helps if avisynth does not return.
Use program options > Save/Load > 'Backup session when previewing' and the accesses in threads to minimize the risk of losing the script.
*/

--------------------------
Version 2.6.7.6 [2021-05-09] GPo
--------------------------
* Values of the sliders can only be changed with the mouse wheel if the left mouse button is held down
-  (prevents changing without performing a refresh, Win10) 
* The drawing of the video frame slightly changed (if row size != pitch) faster now.
- especially affects the preview filter if there is a resize filter in the preview filter (or crop is used) 
* Extra background color for the sliders can optionally be switched on or off (Fonts and colors)
** AvsPThumb does not work with this version. Update follows.
/*
Bookmarks navigation menu has been removed without replacement. Reason:
I have been looking for a bug for almost 12 months that caused me a 4-5% increased CPU load when the slider window is visible.
The bookmark menu is the culprit, there are entries there and if these entries are emptied and filled again when you change tabs,
this leads to very strange behavior. I've looked at all the calls to this routine and can't find any errors.
I think this is a wx bug
*/

--------------------------
Version 2.6.7.5 [2021-05-02] GPo
--------------------------
* Just a bug fix version 
* If only preview filters were in the script, the slider window button may not have been set to enabled 
* An error could arise if only one tab was available and 'Split View' has been activated.

--------------------------
Version 2.6.7.4 [2021-05-01] GPo
--------------------------
* New checkbox in the slider window 'Disable refresh'
- if checked: several filter parameters can be changed with the sliders without triggering an immediate refresh. 
- the refresh is only carried out when the video window gets the focus or through other actions that trigger a refresh. 
- Exceptions are the preview filters, which are treated normally.
- But if a non-preview filter parameter is changed, the preview filter is switched off. 
- default value can be changed under program options > User sliders > 'Disable refresh as default'
* Win10 bugfix: program restart from options dialog create a new tab
* Some other fixes and code improvements.

--------------------------
Version 2.6.7.3 [2021-04-24] GPo
--------------------------
* Snapshot buttons in the slider window have got a context menu (Restore to current, Restore to new tab, Clear all) 
* The background color of the sliders in the slider window can be changed. (Options > Font and colors > Advanced 2 )
* Some new menu entries in the slider window and toggle tag context menus 
* Under Win10, the mouse wheel should now also work on the video slider (if video window visible). 
* Fixed: With the new wx version the Navigate > Bookmarks menu no longer worked. 
*/
One user did not like the fact that a message appeared in the status bar when the script was saved. 
Now if the script is saved without changes, no more messages appear. Messages appear if the script is changed while saving,
i.e. if toggle tags and filters are removed or an AvsP marked section is added to the script. 
These messages are displayed for at least 3-4 seconds and disappear when you move the mouse in the video window. 
Therefore, important messages are still displayed in the status bar. Without extra options for it.
*/

--------------------------
Version 2.6.7.2 [2021-04-18] GPo
--------------------------
* Video window scroll bars can be hidden Options > 'Hide video window scrollbars'
* Auto preview now also works when switching tabs with the mouse wheel (if mouse wheel is set for tab change) 
* Toggle tags can be created or removed for the selected filter in the context menu of the slider window.
* The toggle tags in the slider window have been given a context menu. Remove, Add child, Remove child
- so there is the possibility with 'Add child' to create a check-radio item from two toggle tags. 
- but use the toggle tags in the slider window with care, not everything can always be checked and changed automatically. 
- the filter name can change in the slider window if e.g. the same filter is added again. 
- if you not need or like it you can remove the menu entries under program options > User sliders > 'Hide slider window toggle tag menus'
* Bugfix Special Comment #> only working correctly in the preview filters.
- the special comment characters #> are a bit confusing. Sorry. Hopefully I didn't get lost with this option.
- everything in the line behind #> is registered in AvsPmod as a text change and thus the script is then reinitialized. 
- although in reality (for avisynth) there are no changes. For avisynth it is a normal comment.
- at the moment it is only used for saving toggle tags within the script, but it also opens up possibilities for other functions. 
- use it only for the toggle tags when a toggle tag is alone in a line. 
 * And a few more code changes and a different wx version 
** It's always a tightrope walk between functionality and ease of use **

--------------------------
Version 2.6.7.1 [2021-04-11] GPo
--------------------------
* The matrix (YUV > RGB) stored in the script (tv601, tv709) is preferably used. If the entry is found no matrix is read from the source.
* If the > character is used after the comment character #, the comment is displayed in a different font #> 
- the font can be set under Options > Fonts and Colors > Basic 1 > 'Comment extra #>' 
Please set the font before using it for the first time. I can only load the default font theme. For example, if the dark theme is used, the font is not set correctly.
If you use the dark theme you only have to reload the dark theme under 'Fonts and Colors'. 
-
* Toggle tags can be saved with the script. Program options > User sliders > 'Save toggle tags ...' Please read the tooltip!
#>[sharp=0]
sharpen (0.40)
#>[/ sharp]
- toggle tags are displayed with the font 'Comment extra' and the toggle tags are only comments for other programs.
- in AvsPmod sharpen is disabled [sharp=0], but in other programs not. 
- when opening in an external player (AvsP button) , the deactivated filters in the preview script are still removed. Everything as usual. 
If you remove the toggle tags 'Clear all tags' and you have used the characters #> in front of the tag, and the option 'Save toggle tags' is enabled, 
then all these characters will also be removed if the line contains only this characters. 
The whole thing is intended to not lose the toggle tags when saving the script and not to have to use the function 'Save or read AvsPmod markings'. 
Because so far the toggle tags were only saved in the session file or in the AvsPmod marked section.
-
* Added the possibility of using the toggle tag checkbox as a radio item. 
- the name must be split into two parts by > and the second name must be present as a checkbox.
-
#>[sharp>unsharp=1]  # the check-radio box
sharpen(0.4)
#>[/sharp]
-
#>[unsharp=0]  # the child checkbox
unsharpmask()
#>[/unsharp]
- in this example clicking on 'sharp>unsharp' toggles between the filters sharpen and unsharpmask. Useful in the preview filters.
-
* Add Toggle tag for one line, now the line must not be selected, only the cursor just needs to be on the line. 
* Progress Dialog resize fix for Win OS versions below Win7
* Added Options > 'Show available memory' displays for 3 seconds the available system mem in the status bar. 
* The status bar displays also the available memory while loading the clip
* Added DGHDRToSDR to the database
-
And a note:
The sliders are a fine thing, but you should also use them with the right feeling.
Use the filter exclusion list for the sliders. The creation of the sliders is time and resource consuming, minimize this effort to what is necessary. 
source filters, trim, crop, addborders, prefetch, etc. can also be set wonderfully in the script.
And there is still the possibility to switch the list on and off in the slider window if you want to see all of them.

--------------------------
Version 2.6.7.0 [2021-04-03] GPo
--------------------------
* Threads slightly revised. 
* Split View now loads the second frame in a thread if threading is enabled. 
* New menu Edit > Insert > 'Preview filter', insert Preview filter syntax for the selected lines ( Ctrl + P )
- keyboard shortcuts may have to be checked, previously printing was linked to it, now (Shift + P) 
* In the preview filter it is now possible to switch individual filters on or off  (Edit > Insert > 'Tag selection for toggling')
-   /**avsp_filter
-   [sharpen=0]
-   sharpen(0.4)
-   [/sharpen]
-   unsharp()
-   **/
* In the preview filters you can now also use sliders that you have created yourself. I think ... I don't support this though.
- I only support automatically generated sliders that are stored in the database or options.
* Show free memory (program options > Misc 2)  
- after creating a new clip displays the free system memory for 3 seconds in the status bar if the free memory less then x MB
* Threads was enabled by default. Sorry. (on/off options menu 'Access Avisnth in threads')
- If the threading works on your system, they offer more script security in the event of an avisynth error (hang). So turn it on.  
- for more info please reade the readme_threads.txt

--------------------------
Version 2.6.6.9 [2021-03-27] GPo
--------------------------
** The syntax for the preview filter end has changed. The Preview Filter Area must now be completed with **/
-    /**avsp_filter
-   sharpen(0.4)
-   **/
* First public release with thread access to avisynth on create/release clip and get frame
- on/off options menu 'Access Avisnth in threads'
- default turned off, but I recommend turning on the threads and only to deactivate if there are problems.
- for more info please reade the readme_threads.txt
* Display YUV -> RGB conversion (Resolution-based, BT,709, BT.601) now script related.
- conversion coefficient can be read from the source (frame properties). Or from the script when it was previously manually stored in the script. 
- an asterisk * is preceded when the matrix has not read from the source ( *Rec601 ) 
- under Program Options > Configure Statusbar, there is a new value %DYR to display the used matrix in the status bar.
* Preview filter handling with the sliders revised. Should everything run a little better. ;)
* Still some changes
 
--------------------------
Version 2.6.6.8 [2021-02-13] GPo
--------------------------
* Fix threaded playback with 'Auto' drop frames

--------------------------
Version 2.6.6.7 [2021-02-13] GPo
--------------------------
* New playback function Video > Play video > 'Use separate thread' 
- Is switched on as standard, deactivate in case of problems or to compare.
- So far the playback runs asynchronously in the main thread, if the function is activated, a separate thread is used for it. 
-
- The advantages are an immediate reaction to input from the mouse or keyboard. 
- Disadvantages:
-- Python threads behave differently than I am usually used to, therefore I can not yet estimate whether there are further disadvantages or even insurmountable problems.
-- Unexpectedly! So far it's been going smoothly for me.
-----
* Fixed, I think: The playback continues if avisynth does not return a frame. (in both playback routines)
* Fixed, slider window radio button labels now react to a mouse click (went lost through custom colors)

--------------------------
Version 2.6.6.6 [2021-02-06] GPo
--------------------------
* Added predefined 'Default dark' editor theme  
* Also added slider window custom theme colors
-- program options > user slider > 'Enable slider window custom theme colors'
-- the colors can be set under otions > Fonts and colors > 'Advanced 2'

--------------------------
Version 2.6.6.5 [2021-02-02] GPo
--------------------------
* The filter exclusion list of the sliders has been revised, now also works with multiple identical filters. 
-- my proposition for exclusion list (trim crop prefetch and 'Your SourceFilters'). The list can be changed options > User sliders
* The filter exclusion list can be activate or deactivate in the context menu of the sliders.
* Some changes to preview filter and sliders:
-- preview filter index is showing on the sliders
-- the decision for 'use' direct slider update improved (direct update only if slider in current preview filter). 
* Update database, add 'ffms2_FFMS2', 'GamMac', 'TemporalDegrain2', update 'RGBAdjust', SmoothCurveC3
* Some other changes

--------------------------

* Error window font size now with DPI scaling
* Step frame buttons got a context menu (frame, second, minute, custom jump). For those who can't let go of their mouse and beer ;)
* Fixed separate video window zoom and flickering on tab change with mouse browse buttons.
* Fixed separate video window shows no bookmarks and selections.
* Fixed encoder_gui.py shows no path buttons, and a new button in the config part (please delete the encoder_gui.pyo)

--------------------------
Version 2.6.6.0 [2021-01-05] GPo, Happy New Year Edition
--------------------------
* Added to tab context menu 'Auto preview' find it out ;)
* Tabs shown an indictor if clip not initialized (preview not ok)  '>'

--------------------------
* Options > Misc > 'Use large video controls' replaced by options > Misc 2 > 'DPI scaling video controls'
* Changed some functions for DPI awareness
*** Important*** The Guis in the Tools folder need to be updated.
-- avs2avi_gui.py, encoder_gui.py, resize_calc.py
-- To do this, the files must be overwritten and all .pyo files in the 'tools' dirctory deleted.
-- Or unzip AvsPmod in a new directory and copy the options.dat from the old to the new directory. 
-- Then copy the .dat files from the 'tools' directory to the new 'tools' directory. So that the settings of the Guis are retained.
*Mary Christmas*

--------------------------
Version 2.6.5.2 [2020-12-20] GPo
--------------------------
* Added context menu to the 'play' button (right click)
* Removed Play video > 'Drop frames'
-- 'Drop frames' now in the play button context menu
-- 'Auto' is the old one (video frame rate related)
-- manually (2 - 16) is nice for fast playback (without filters), I get 1800 fps on maximum speed (but that's not real fps) ;)
* Again tab bookmarks handling slightly revised. And that's not the end.
* Synchronisation between 'menu bar' and 'context menu' items 'is item checked' improved.
* Beta: High DPI Awareness
-- added to menu Help 'DPI info'

-- set 'DPI scaling overall' to value 5 for 150 % scaling 
-- play with the other values
-- It's beta, so some elements may be not scaled

-- you can also use the scaling without a high resolution monitor.

--------------------------
Version 2.6.5.1 [2020-12-06] GPo
--------------------------
* Set tab bookmarks from session file slightly revised. 
* 'Play loop' repeats playback at the end of the clip even without selections.
* Playback continue after tab change if the new clip in the same group or it is a similar clip (frame count and dimensions-size).
* Added to menu Trim editor > 'Selections to script'  and 'Selections from script', does what the title says.
-- even if I repeat myself: Selections are made when 'Copy to clipboard' is selected in the Trim Editor.
* Small other changes

--------------------------
Version 2.6.5.0 [2020-11-27] GPo
--------------------------
* Added to tab context menu 'Save view pos on tab change'
* Added to frame text field context menu 'Set bookmark title'
-- the title of the current bookmark is set with the text in the frame text field
* Added to menu Trim Editor 'Clear all selections Globally', clears all selections in all tabs, see below
* Selections now tab related if 'Tab change loads bookmarks' selected
* Session file saves and restores the selections for each script
-- info: Selections are made when you select 'Copy to Clipboard' in the Trim Editor
-- if selections visible and 'Play loop' enabled the playback plays then only the selections
* New Mouse browse buttons and key events if 'tab change' or 'bookmark jump' for mouse browse buttons selected.
-- CTRL on video window = bookmark jump (only needed if tab count greater 1)
-- SHIFT = jump to selection marks (also works with video control buttons 'bookmark jump')
-- ALT = jump only to titled bookmarks (also works with video control buttons 'bookmark jump')
* Fixed the big error on File > 'Close all tabs'
* Fixed on loading from session file bookmarks can be assigned to the wrong tab
* A lot of code changes 

*** Note for script writers: ***
The AvsPmod bookmark list was changed, only type 0 bookmarks may be added to the bookmark list.
Use 'MacroSetBookmark'  when adding your bookmarks type 0 or 'AddFrameBookmark' when adding a mark (type 0,1,2)
There is now a 'SelectionsDict' in which the selections are saved (type 1,2).

--------------------------
Version 2.6.4.9 [2020-11-14] GPo
--------------------------
* The sliders window:
-- If the key 'Control' is pressed while using the Increment and Decrement buttons next to the sliders, 
-- the change in the value is 5 times slower (the key Control does not have to be held down).
-- But it is almost superfluous. Noticed too late: with left Mous down on the slider and then mouse wheel you can do it in single steps
* Some fixes.
-- warning for different bookmarks (script, tab) was broken in 2.6.4.3
-- zoom 'Window fit' resizes automatically if video height smaller then window height
-- key shortcuts for 'Zoom' fires after program start not on the first event
-- 'Split View' zoom 'Window fit' improved

--------------------------
Version 2.6.4.8 [2020-11-11] GPo
--------------------------
* Some improvments to zoom setting 'Antialiasing' and the program interface
-- scroll bars movement as fast as without antialiasing
-- revised zoom 'Window fill'
-- a few other changes

--------------------------
Version 2.6.4.7 [2020-11-10] GPo
--------------------------
Again bug fixes caused by the new zoom function 'Antialiasing'

--------------------------
Version 2.6.4.6 [2020-11-10] GPo
--------------------------
Bug fixes caused by the new zoom function 'Antialiasing'.

--------------------------

* Fixed zoom setting 'Antialiasing' cannot be disabled with key shortcut

--------------------------
Version 2.6.4.4 [2020-11-08] GPo
--------------------------
** If there are any problems, it's a test version, if not, it's a regular one ;)
* New menu Video > Zoom > 'Antialiasing', draws the preview antialiased (bilinear) if the zoom is not equal to 100%
-- drawing requires more power, I have done a lot that the preview does not jerk with mouse movements or playback. 
-- but when the scroll bars are moved manually you can feel the difference.
-- It will be temporarily deactivated during playback or if crop editor shown and on some other events. 
-- check it out, I don't know if it works on all systems without errors. 
-- And I don't know yet whether it will be kept. It took a lot of effort to implement it and if it causes bigger problems then I throw it out.
* New Options > Video > 'Startup with last zoom settings'
* Small other (fixes) changes

--------------------------
Version 2.6.4.3 [2020-11-01] GPo
--------------------------
* 'New tab from snapshot' now sets the current frame number (if possible)
* Get pixel info from avisynth now disabled if snapshot visible
* Fixed 'Copy to new tab' not copying the tab bookmarks

--------------------------
Version 2.6.4.2 [2020-10-31] GPo
--------------------------
* New Menu 'Video > Snapshot': Intended for resource-saving comparison of simple settings (sharpness, color, etc.)
-- 'Take snapshot' stores a bitmap from the current frame (tab related)
-- 'Show/hide snapshot',  if the snapshot frame number and current frame number different, you must hit again 'Show/hide snapshot'.
-- At the top left the video window shows which snapshot is displayed.
-- Use shortcuts so that you can easily take, show or hide the snapshot.
-- Snapshot hides only automatically if the frame number changed or crop editor is shown (at the moment)
-- Further menus: Clear tab snapshot, Clear all snapshots Globally, New tab (script) from snapshot
* Tab bookmarks now saves the bookmark titles
* Added 'Bookmarks > Titled bookmarks > Remove all title', removes all titles from the current tab bookmarks
 
--------------------------
Version 2.6.4.1 [2020-10-16] GPo
--------------------------
* New item in Bookmarks menu 'Clear tab bookmarks' clears only the current tab bookmarks (idea by real.finder)
-- is disabled if tab context menu option 'Tab change loads bookmarks' is disabled
* 'Clear all bookmarks' renamed to 'Clear all bookmarks Globally'
* Fixed zoom option 'fill window'
* Fixed current tab bookmarks not always saved in session file

--------------------------
Version 2.6.4.0 [2020-10-10] GPo
--------------------------
* Added to tab context menu 'Split View insert tab'
-- inserts a copy of the current tab next to the current tab and activates Split View.
* High Res icon now as default app symbol icon (again thanks to Doom9 user 'color')
* Small other changes

--------------------------
Version 2.6.3.9 [2020-09-16] GPo
--------------------------
* Split View small changes (zoom, error handling)
* AvsMeter.exe 3040 args has changed, you must change the args under otions > paths > 'external tool' 
-- arg1 use  AvsMeter info|-avsinfo
-- arg2 use  AvsMeter|%fn   ( %fn is now needed to pass the script file name )
* New AvsPmod.exe file with high res app icon. Many thanks to user 'color' from the Doom9 forum
-- for all Win10 Tile Fritzen, in German it sounds better (Fr alle Win10 Kachel Fritzen) ;)
-- and for those who use large desktop icons. 
-- use it, delete it, sell it, do what you want with it
-- if you use it, you have to replace the AvsPmod.exe in the root directory with this high res version.
-- the file is in the folder 'AvsPmod_high_res_ico_version'

--------------------------
Version 2.6.3.8 [2020-09-13] GPo
--------------------------
* Split View rewritten
- no selection of next or previous tab, the next tab is always the second view
- if the last tab is selected when Split View is activated, the previous tab is used as the first view
- the split view tabs can now be switched back and forth and split view remains activated. 
---- e.g.: activate Split View on tab 1, you can switch between tab 1 and tab 2 and Split View remains switched on.
- script update and error handling improved

--------------------------
Version 2.6.3.7 [2020-09-11] GPo
--------------------------
*New function called Split View (Check it out)
- Splits the video window in two views and draws (optional) the next or previous tab in the same View.
- Both videos must have the same width and height.
- When you select video > 'Split View on/off' and Split View is disabled:
--- if tab count 1, the tab is copied and Split View is enabled
--- if tab count 2, Split View selects the correct tab automatically and splits the view
--- if under options Video > 'Use next tab for Split View' selected: the next tab is the second view otherwise the previous tab
- if a tab is changed, Split View is always deactivated
- always the left view is the source for zoom and positions calculations
- To avoid confusion, remember: if 'use next tab' (default) the left view is the selected tab, otherwise the right view is the selected tab
- Choose your option, the default value 'next tab' was only used because it is more manageable at first.
* The menus in the video menu has ben repositioned

--------------------------
Version 2.6.3.6 [2020-08-30] GPo
--------------------------
fixed the new version cannot load the old session files

--------------------------
Version 2.6.3.5 [2020-08-29] GPo
--------------------------
*When changing tabs and 'Tab change loads bookmarks' is enabled:
- if the tab has no bookmarks, bookmarks now cleared
- the current tab bookmarks are saved and restored even if they were not previously written into the script
- if bookmarks reading from script and bookmarks from tab different a message appears (can be disabled under options)
-- useful: if you add bookmarks and change the tab but you forgot to save the bookmarks to the script, you can now restore the bookmarks
*Save Session, Load Session saves and loads the bookmarks for each script.
*Fixed the selection marks bug on tab change and on restore bookmark from selections mark
*New macro 'Open Image Sequence.py' read the information inside the macro
*A bit of cosmetics in the text field context menu

--------------------------
Version 2.6.3.4 [2020-08-05] GPo
--------------------------
- Changed: If trim dialog is shown you can again jump to any bookmark. (@in4u) 
- When you close all tabs or the last tab, all bookmarks now deleted.

--------------------------
*Bookmarks now restored if a trim editor selection mark over a bookmark and the selection mark deleted  
*Playback improved, smoother playback (If the 'fps' can be reached)
*New macro 'Selected trims to selections'
- Insert all selected avisynth trims as trim editor selections. Or deled the selection if it exist.
- e.g. script selection is #Trim(10, 100) ++ Trim(120, 200).Reverse() , insert selection 10-100 and 120-200
*Fixed: The video slider was highlighted after closing the trim editor and a bookmark was selected.
*Fixed: Crop editor drawn the cropped area on large zoom not correctly +- 1pix ;)

--------------------------
Version 2.6.3.0 [2020-07-11] GPo
--------------------------

--------------------------
Version 2.6.2.9 [2020-07-10] GPo
--------------------------
*Added to menu Video > Play video > 'Play loop'
- Plays the trim editor selections from frame start to frame end in a loop
- Press Home (Pos1) select the trims then select 'Copy to clipboard' and hit 'Ok', the selections are retained.
*Added a clear button to 'Trim selection editor'. Clears all trim editor selections.
*Also added to menu Video > Trim selection editor > 'Clear selections'. Clears all trim editor selections.
*If you begin playback and the current frame is the last frame, playback starts at frame 0 or loop_start is 'Play loop' selected
*Added: When the Trim editor is visible and the video slider is on a start or end mark, the color is highlighted. 
- also added to frame text field context menu 'selection highlight color...' set the color for highlighting the selection mark
*Changed: If the trim editor is visible, only the selections marks are selected with the buttons 'bookmark jump'.
- if the trim editor is not visible, this can be done by holding down the control key.
- the same behavior when the mouse pointer is in the slider area and ctrl is pressed and you use the mouse browse buttons.
*Add or remove # with mouse left press and right click improved. Doesn't now change if # or ~ or * the next char, e.g. Style or Block comment.
*If word boolean selected (True,False) press left and right click changes the boolean value. (left down, left up, left down and hold down, then right click)
*Menu Tools > 'Script encoder (CLI)'
- if you change the output path manually, the directory is now created if it does not exist
- added option 'Output file name to new tab', insert in a new tab the output name depended of the source files templates
- !! For the update you must delete 'tools\encoder_gui.pyo' if it exists.!!
*Fix: With a mouse click on the video slider area the position was not changed if play back was active.
***This stubborn error message 'MOUSE_CAPTURE_LOST' has been fixed. Error log should now remain empty ;)
and some real improvements

--------------------------
Version 2.6.2.8 [2020-07-04] GPo

--------------------------
Version 2.6.2.4 [2020-05-24] GPo

--------------------------
Version 2.6.2.3 [2020-05-23] GPo
--------------------------
Sorry for the save options bug in the last version. Component for mouse wheel func was changed but the option name not.
After fixing the wrong name, the bug still occurred if the own options were kept and no new value was set in the options 
for the mouse wheel function. That is now fixed.

Added and Changes:
- Press Ctrl and double click on the video window, expands the height some pixels
- Temporal enable/disable show 'Filter calltips' even if the option disabled: 
---- Edit > Avisynth function > 'Show calltip' you can assign a key shortcut, I use F1
---- Options > Text > 'Show filter calltips Ctrl+Alt' when key Ctrl+Alt together pressed enables/disables calltips temporal
-------- Beta, no idea if there are any conflicts with user defined shortcuts. But I do not think.
- During playback, the fps is displayed in the status bar in real time. This is an average value.
- The normal playback routine has become a bit speed improvement, but I recommend the new one. 'Use faster playback routine'
Misc:
- fixed: program crashes If a user slider was changed and playback was active.
- some code changes

--------------------------

--------------------------
- Added: Menu Video > Play video > 'Use faster playback function', 0 % to 38 % faster playback, depending on CPU load.
- Changed: during playback no pixel information is shown in the status bar. It is pointless to show.
- Changed component for 'mouse wheel function' please select your option new
---- Item 'Tab change or scroll' behaves like the original version 2.5.1
- Issues fixed, script doesn't updated immediately.

--------------------------

--------------------------
- bugfix frame text input:
     The text is now no longer selected, as a substitute the background color of the entire field is now changed.
     The wxPython version I use generates a wx.Bell event when I enter 'Enter' on the keyboard, I don't like that. 
     That's why I chose the lesser evil for me (and for you?).

--------------------------
Version 2.6.1.9 [2020-04-29] GPo (small changes)
--------------------------
- Add new avisynth type 'a' (avisynth with array, pinterf v3.52)

    - Are there tabs with similar videos or tabs with the same group, then only these tabs are selected (As usual).
        - Otherwise all tabs are run through.
        -  (The option for 'similar' or 'group' can be changed under Option > Video)

--------------------------
On the topic: Save or read marked script
- By default 'Save or read marked script' is now activated again.
- Optional selectable warnings removed, keep it simple.
New behavior:
The md5 hash of the original script is now saved within the 'AvsP marked script' and is compared when it is reopened.
If there are differences, a warning appears, this warning cannot be deactivated.
So you can turn on to save or read 'AvsP marked scripts' and you only get a warning if the original has been changed.

--------------------------
Version 2.6.1.2 [2020-02-29] GPo
--------------------------

--- at this error, if you press 'Cancel', the session and script is saved as '_LastErrorSession.ses, _LastErrorScript.avs' in the AvsP program folder. Hopefully.;)
--- !!! On my test, however, (paranoid mode is not for me)

--------------------------

- Fixed garbage data displayed on shortcut labels
- Fixed wrong checked/unchecked status for 'Flip' menu items.
- Improve menu item 'Hide the preview' to 'Show/Hide the preview.
- Fixed missing customized function presets (This situation happened if an uninstalled plugin is not in filterdb.dat and has no customized definition. Now, avsp will check and keep its definiton as customized definition to avoid missing its preset. If the reason is from renaming, you can copy old preset to new one and then delete. But, leaving it there is also harmless.)


Version 2.1.6 [2011-05-23]
--------------------------

- Add 'Show autocomplete with variables' to 'Program setting|Text2'. AvsPmod will parse the script and add variable names to the autocomplete list.
- Add 'Show autocomplete on single matched' to 'Program setting|Text2'. This can be helpful when using lowercase, such as for a variable name.
- Add 'Show autocomplete with icons' to 'Program setting|Text2'. This should be helpful to decide which key is better to finish autocomplete, <Enter> or <Tab>. There are 3 different types of icon to indicate how well a filter's preset is defined:
  - OK icon: well-defined (100%)
  - Smile icon: good (>70%)
  - None: 30-70%
  - Question icon: bad (<30%)
- Remove "Allow hyphen in identifier" and also remove illegal long names from autocomplete list.
- Add 'ESC' into "Configure shortcuts->Advanced". If checked, one press doesn't run shortcut command when autocomplete or calltip is active. A second press is needed. If unchecked, directly run command. Default: unchecked.
- Add "Show warning on bad plugin naming" to "Program settings->Misc". If plugin dll files contain characters other than alphanumeric or underscore, it will be suggested that you rename them.
- Allow autocomplete auto active on starting with underscore if there are matched words existing.
- When autocomplete or calltip is active, pressing related shortcut again will cancel it.
- Fixed an issue with filenames in the encoding gui.
